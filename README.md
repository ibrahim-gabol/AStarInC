# AStarInC
A* pathfinding algorithm in c.


In main.c, there is setup for nodes in the 2D Plane. 

The algorithm uses a combined heuristic as dictated in the A* algorithm, to find the shortest path between two nodes. Example is given in main.c

The algorithm ignores the shorter paths south from S, because they are straying further from E.
